# All Acess Pass

## Capstone Project of the Web Development bootcamp at neuefische

One of the key features of our app is the collection of new interviews with musicians. We go beyond just the mainstream artists and cover emerging talents as well. Our interviews are insightful and provide valuable insights on the music industry and the creative process.

In addition to interviews, our app allows bands to book their events and promote their shows to a wider audience. Whether you are organizing a small gig or a large concert, our app provides an easy-to-use interface for booking and promoting your events. 

Overall, our music app is a must-have for music lovers and musicians alike.
