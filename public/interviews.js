Having already released a Demo (2011), the “Killed by Thrash” EP (2013), full length albums “High on Radiation” (2014) and “Heavy” (2016), Reactory is currently working on their third full material.The four catalysts behind Reactory Thrash warhead are: Hänz Hazard (vox), Jerry Reactor (guitar),  Jonny Master (bass) and Caue Dos Santos (drums).As always, a huge *Thank You* to the band for their time, openness and availability!MAtW – Welcome Thrash masters, greetings from MAtW! It’s an honour to have you with us. What is the current mood in Reactory?Hello Cristina! Thanks for the interest in Reactory. 

    Right now, to be honest, the mood is great. I mean, we are all tired as hell from a long ride back home to Berlin but very satisfied and proud after a week recording our new album nearby Köln. It was intense and we are really looking forward to bring it out. Personally I am still so pumped about it that I need some time to calm down. 
    
    Answering this interview is doing the job. MAtW – You guys are working on your 3rd full album – any spoilers?All we can say for now is that we put a lot of passion and energy into it during the whole process and some of the best songs we have written up until now are there. Of course we hope thrashers will dig it, but we follow our instinct and at the end of the day, it sounds like us.`,
