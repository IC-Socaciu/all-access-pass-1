<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Thank you for your time. What is Undertaker doing now?</strong></p>

*Hello, we’re currently doing a lot of live shows in Tokyo, the center of Japan. And now I’m writing a lot of songs. I’m writing it for the new album.*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Let’s meet the band. Can you tell us a little bit about each member of the band and their role within the group?</strong></p>

*First of all, I’m NEMO, guitar vocalist. Mainly writing new riffs and writing lyrics. And at the live, this is the man who is venting his anger at the center.*

*The guitarist is 4410. He is originally from classical music. He does the booking and arrangement publicity for the band.*

*And the drummer is Hong. He is a very studious drummer who is studying a lot of music now.* 

*The bassist is a session bassist, but he’s a genius. He can listen to the performance with peace of mind.*

filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Is the current line-up stable or are there different musicians joining the live show?</strong></p>

*The bassist is a session member. The rest of the line-up is stable. Because we used to be friends. We often drink and play together.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  For international readers unfamiliar with The Undertaker, can you tell us how it started?</strong></p>

*This band just let out what’s inside everyone in the midst of this damned pandemic. I started out playing. However, I made a lot of good songs, so I started showing them in front of everyone. I started playing like a party, but now I’m serious about it.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  How would you describe your music to someone who has never heard it?**

*Our music is a mixture of 90’s alternative, hard rock, hardcore and rock. Of course, it also smells like good old rock. Think of it as a new sound playing with modern sounds.*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Tell us more about your current EP.</strong></p>

*The current EP was originally a demo, but all 4 songs were great songs, so I dropped them into the world. The reaction was good. It was ranked #16 on iTunes. It’s sprinkled with psychedelic vibes, hardcore and rock sounds.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  How are the songs written, are they collaborative or are they usually led by one of her members?</strong></p>

*Where NEMO usually writes riffs and melodies, we jam always. I don’t compromise, but I enjoy it.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Where do you get your musical inspiration from?</strong></p>

*We find new inspiration in everything we’ve heard, amazing scenery and good times. I like exciting things.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  What do you like most and dislike about being a musician?</strong></p>

*What you like is to be able to live by doing what you like. Even if we are caught in something, it will break that frame. That’s why musicians can’t quit their jobs.* 

*What I don’t like is that the world is getting louder and louder. Maybe it’s mostly because of social net media.*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  You just signed a new partnership with Split Screen Management. How did the collaboration come about?</strong></p>

*They have been able to maintain a good partnership continuing from my previous band. They work hard for the band. That’s why I love it. Great management company.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  What’s next for The Undertaker?</strong></p>

*I want to make an album. And I want to tour a lot and make new trips!*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  How did you get into music? Was it always part of your life or did you focus on it later on?</strong></p>

*I love guitar and it’s been my life since the beginning.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Are either of you involved in musical or non-musical side projects?</strong></p>

*Right now I’m just concentrating on this band.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  The year started with quite a few live shows. How has the reaction been so far?</strong></p>

*The reaction is good. People are very interested. However, it’s hard to categorize it because it’s a sound I had never heard before.*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Do you have any upcoming shows?</strong></p>

*There are a lot of shows booked, mainly in Tokyo, until the fall. Of course I want to tour Europe if I have the chance.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  You are a very visual band when playing live. What should fans expect from your show?</strong></p>

*We double as a show-up to Rock’s bluntness. That’s why I’m progressing through stages that I can’t read every time. Is that more thrilling?*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Do you get nervous before the show?</strong></p>

*I’m having fun these days, so I’m not nervous. My previous band was always nervous and crazy enough to want to hurt someone. I’m quietly concentrating. I train the image of the stage all the time.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Do you have any funny or interesting stories from the show so far that you could share with us?</strong></p>

*The support guitarist who was in the front drinks a lot. I drink all the time after loading in. And before the stage, after he checked his guitar, he disappeared. it was the best and the worst story so far.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  Last Question Time – Random Questions. Name at least one thing about Japan that is 100% true and 100% nonsense.</strong></p>

*Japan is a very strange country and rock has yet to become a culture. All pop music and idols make me nauseous. This is serious.* 

*Japan has a lot of weird rules. After that, we will act as a group. The audience gets excited, and if one person gets excited, everyone gets excited.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  If there is anything you would like to share and I may have missed, please do so. We look forward to seeing you in Europe.</strong></p>


*See you in Europe! And thank you for your support!*`,

The band’s sound has been shaped by the many different musical influences of the band’s members: hardcore, punk, doom, extreme metal, grindcore and even black metal. 

Lyrical themes include feminism, anti-capitalism and warnings of an apocalyptic future if humanity continues to let this world go to shit.

Current [GODMORGON](https://www.facebook.com/godmorgonband/) lineup: 

**Itza** - vox

**Marvin** - guitar

**Jan** - bass / vox

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>All Access Pass – Hello, GODMORGON and thank you for taking the time to talk to All Access Pass. It’s a pleasure to have you here!</strong></p>

 *Itza: Thank you for having us!*


 <p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – For newer fans, let’s meet everyone in GODMORGON!</strong></p>

 *I: The band consists of four people: Marvin on guitar, Jan on bass and backing vocals, Simon on the drums and me, Itza, as the lead vocalist.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Your latest material, the “Backlash” EP has been released at the beginning of 2022 and a new single and video for the song “Cataclysm” has just been released in May.

How does it feel to finally have your self-titled debut EP out, in the world?</strong></p>

*I: It was actually quite spontaneous. Our original plan was to record our first album sometime in 2022.*

*But last winter we had an online gig where we had to submit 1-2 pre-recorded songs for a livestream, preferably with live shot videos.*

*We didn’t have that until then and did the songs in one go. We were very happy with how the audio turned out and decided to put it up on Spotify and other streaming services together with our first recorded song from May 2021: “Backlash”.*

*The videos are also on our GODMORGON YouTube channel.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You are already back in the saddle working on your first full album. How are things progressing?</strong></p>

*I: At the moment not as well as we’d like. We are currently quite busy with personal stuff and also preparing and looking forward to our next live show in August. *

*It’s going to be at AZ Mülheim on 13th August! I’m actually organising the event.*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What are some technical details regarding the album?</strong></p>

*I: As before we are recording and mixing everything ourselves again. Simon has become our “sound guy” and coordinates the recording and does the mixing, of course with feedback from the rest of the band.* 

*I think you can really hear the progress in terms of quality of the recordings if you compare e.g. “Backlash” and “Cataclysm”.*
 
*There’s a lot to learn when it comes to audio engineering. For the cover art we don’t have a specific vision yet, but it is probably going to be in the style of the previous covers, so rather a photo than a drawing.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Your previous musical offerings were 100% DIY. There is a lot of work and effort but I can imagine rewarding as well. How are responsibilities shared within GODMORGON?</strong></p> 

*I: As I just mentioned Simon takes care of the recordings. Jan did the Backlash video, in the future it would be cool to make a video together, featuring all band members.* 

*The guitar and bass parts of the songs are usually documented in GuitarPro which is done by Marvin.* 

*I take care of the management and communication side of things, including social media and write almost all of the lyrics.* 

*However, the lyrics for half of our pusblished songs, “Ritual Suicide” and “Backlash”, were written by Jan.* 

*So compared to other bands we really try to share the tasks and everyone has a special niche.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP . How are new ideas being created? And does usually the musical backbone or the lyrics come first?</strong></p>

*I: If someone has a new idea we try to document and send it around or just show it during the next band practice session. Then the others chime in and do their parts.* 

*Some of the songs were created based on lyrics but most of the times the instrumentals come first.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP  – Do you have a practice routine as a band or individually?</strong></p>

*I: We usually meet once a week and most of the practice is done there. We are also quite effective during these sessions.* 

*No drinking and just hanging out – we really practice!*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Is every idea taken into consideration when writing music?</strong></p> 

*I: Everybody is free to suggest something but everyone in the band has to be ok with it. So if we write new parts everyone has to like it.* 

*Otherwise, it will be reworked until everyone is fine with it.*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Your musical styles are quite eclectic. Did the musical direction come natural for you or was it something you decided upon?</strong></p>

*I: It’s funny because we all listen to different styles of music and have different influences and I think you can really hear it in the finished songs.* 

*Marvin really likes musical complexity and is usually the one to suggest a sudden change of pace among other things.*

*Jan has a very different vocal style from me and does long shouts, whereas I usually have a lot to say and pack a lot of lyrics into the songs.* 

*There are a lot of other ways in which we differ musically but I think this is what makes our music interesting – it doesn’t exactly fit one specific genre.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What does GODMORGON find cliche on the metal scene?</strong></p>

*That metal is only for tough guys! I think that’s very outdated but a lot of bands you see still try to fit this image.* 

*For our live show in August, I wanted bands with at least one female member to play with us as most shows just have men on stage. And I found a lot of very cool bands!*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What are some unwritten rules in the industry that you have experienced?</strong></p>

*Not too many as we are still very underground, but so far, I think networking is – as in any industry – very important and helpful.* 

*It’s really beneficial to know some people in the scene and it’s also cool for us to get more and more involved.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Which skills or exp have you gained that help you perform effectively as a musician since the beginning how do they feel that they have evolved as musicians or organisational wise?</strong></p>

*I: Apart from improving our musical skills, our songwriting skills have improved too and nowadays we are very fast.* 

*Like any other skill, you just improve with practice. As mentioned before, we’ve also learned how important networking is within the local scene.* 

*Over time we got to know more and more people which also leads to more opportunities. It was just announced that GODMORGON also joined the local UNTIER Collective.*

*It’s a collective of local bands within the realm of metal and noise because we realised that as bands without labels, we are just stronger together.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What piece of advice would you give bands who are at beginning of their musical road?</strong></p>

*Don’t focus on fitting a certain genre and which label to give yourselves. Your musical style will develop by writing more and more songs.* 

*Be creative and be yourselves!*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Is either of you involved in any musical or non-musical side-projects?</strong></p>

*I: Yes, Simon, Jan and I have two other projects together. One riot grrrl inspired project I initiated because this is also music I listen to and some songs I’ve written just fall into this category.* 

*The other one is a grindcore project. Marvin is interested in starting a hardcore side-project.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What do you find challenging in being an artist, both on a positive spin and a negative one?</strong></p>

*I: It takes time and time is what most of us are lacking. For the management and social media tasks I can always find time to squeeze it in between.* 

*But when you want to focus and be creative you usually need a bit more time and you cannot force it. This can be challenging.*
 
*On the positive side it’s really cool to get feedback from people who listen to your music and be able to share that joy with others.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Do you consider your voice as an instrument – tool?</strong></p>

*I: Definitely! Besides being able to express myself with my lyrics I think, especially with “extreme” vocals you can definitely create a certain atmosphere and get feelings across quite well.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How much of your success do you think is achieved through social media?</strong></p> 

*I: Unfortunately, I think it plays a big role unless you just happen to know lots of people in your local scene.* 

*When looking for bands for gigs people also look at your follower count to determine whether people would be interested in seeing your show.* 

*But first and foremost, we care about music and not generating content all the time. If there’s something worth sharing, we’ll share it though!*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Time for the last question, The Random Question: What is invisible but you wish people would see?</strong></p>

*I: How much of a positive impact just being friendly can have. It doesn’t cost a thing and we should all try to empower each other instead of trying to outdo one another.*

 

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Thank you for taking the time to do this, it was really nice meeting you. In case there is anything else you would like to mention and send a message for your fans, please do so!</strong></p>

*I: Thank you so much for the interview, it was really fun!* 

*I just want to repeat that our next gig is on 13th August at AZ Mülheim. Also check out the other bands in the UNTIER Collective.* 

*And I want to encourage everyone who’s interested in making music to try it out!*

    title: "Toomas Vanem Interview",

    text: `Estonian studio and session guitar virtuoso and composer [TOOMAS VANEM](https://www.facebook.com/ToomasGuitar/‚), started his music career in the 1980s.

*As always, a huge **Thank You** for your time, openness and availability!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Hello, Toomas! Welcome on our virtual pages and thank you for taking the time to do this interview with All-Access-Pass!</strong></p>

*Toomas Vanem: Hi, thank you for the opportunity to talk to you! The pleasure is all mine!*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – The year 2022 kicked off with the release of your newest instrumental album, “Toomas Vanem II”.</strong></p>

*TV – Yes, that’s true. This is my second solo album and to be honest it took me a little too long to finish it. My first one was released 2014 so it is 8 years.* 

*Hope to rise a tempo little bit with the third one, which is in my mind and few things are also on my hard disks already.*

*I am very grateful to all the fabulous people that helped and supported me to finish **“Toomas Vanem II”** and pushed me towards the release. Thank you so much!*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – The tracks on the “Toomas Vanem II” album are just as assorted style-wise but the sound and approach are slightly darker and heavier. 

The influences appear to be infiltrated even more subtly in each song. 

Looking back to your previous solo material “Toomas Vanem I” do the new ideas start spontaneous or you start with a vision of what you want the album to sound like?</strong></p>

*TV – Well there is both! I write music quite spontaneously, whatever comes to my mind and whatever mood I am in, and so on.*
 
*I usually come up with composing about 12-15 songs for album. At some point I stop and start looking back what I have written, and choose tracks that will end up on the album, and finish them* 

*I might change also the arrangements to fit the overall mood a bit for album.*

*In general I want my album to sound happy and make people feeling good while listening to it. On my first solo album I was experimenting with different styles.* 

*On new album the experimenting continues and to be honest my vision or goal for the great instrumental guitar album is kind of old school maybe, but I like Jeff Beck records for instance, where tracks wary little bit genre or style-wise, but there is still Jeff’s guitar playing on top all of them.* 

*And you don’t get bored listening. Those are different stories that guitar player is telling you through his music on the album.* 

*I have listened to some so called conceptual albums, where for me, there is really only one song happening on the album, all the other tracks are kind of versions of that same song.* 

*I try to avoid that with my albums. I like stories! It keeps things fresh for me! With that in mind, my albums are conceptual, just I have a different concept!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How did the collaboration with Andrus Lillepea, Kyle Hughes, Henno Kelp, Runno Tamra come about?</strong></p>

*TV – Andrus and Henno are good buddies of mine and hell of a great professional musicians. They are my partners to do also live shows with when we have a chance to play my music.* 

*Kyle Hughes appears on the album as quest star. He somehow heard my first album and liked it so much that contacted me and offered to play tracks to my new album.* 

*I said why not, lets do it, and Kyle did his brilliant drumming at UK and send files to me over the internet.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Do you have a personal favorite track off the “Toomas Vanem II” album? And why?</strong></p>

*TV – Well, not really. I dig them all.*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – As an artist that masters both, would you tip the scales in favour of melody or virtuosity? 

Which one is more important or if this is the same case for you?</strong></p>

*TV – For me, music is melody! The melody could be simple and It could be super complex, but it has to touch your ears as a listener on emotional basis.*

*Music without melody is not music at all for me. There exists music without a melody but I am not super excited about that.*

*I think some sort of virtuosity is also needed to impress listeners and entertain your audience or public.* 

*But it does not mean that you must or have play fast. Virtuosity is much more than just random fast shred on the neck of the guitar.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is you composing approach, you seem to use lot of scales and unusual chords and harmonies. 

Tell us more about how you write your music?</strong></p>

*TV – The chords and scales are the same thing really. For my compositional concept chords and harmonies comes from scales.* 

*On both my albums I have used plenty of unusual exotic scales. By that I mean I try to look away, to the different direction from major/minor or blues scale. Which are also fine.*

*I have used Indian scales (Pantuvarali) and Modes of melodic minor and other stuff.* 

*Thing is, I take a scale and write it down on the paper, all the different chords that are possible to construct from that scale notes.* 

*Then I start experimenting and playing around with those chords, and compose melodies or riffs out of that scale, and modulate and do other crazy stuff.* 

*This is nothing new to jazz musicians or players. But in rock music this is not so common.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – When writing new music do you seclude yourself from any influences or, on the contrary, listen to more music and expose yourself to more styles and new artists?</strong></p>

*TV – I think that I can not seclude myself from the influences that I have, cause they are deep inside of me anyway.* 

*But what I do when I am writing, I try to let go of everything that I have heard and let my imagination fly free.* 

*And move fast to the directions that my creative mind wants to go. I don’t want to finish the details as I write, cause this would put breaks and stop the creative juice flowing.* 

*I can always come back later, next day and re-polish things when I am arranging/producing the song.*

*And another thing is that I am constantly trying to grow to not sound as other artists and would like to have my own style.* 

*But of course everything that is around influences you, by that I mean everything, not just music.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –What is your guitar practice routine?</strong></p>



*TV – When I was younger then I think I had some practice routine, But now I just practice when it is needed.* 

*And It always happens to be in the last minute…hahaha… Like before new gig with my music from my albums. Try to figure out, how the hell I am gonna play this stuff.* 

*But seriously just to get my fingers moving I do from time to time some exercising. It could be Frank Gambali’s „Chop Builder“ video that will get me in shape pretty quickly or some other stuff.*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Do you have any favourite gear piece / setup? You also seem to be quite open to 6+ stringed guitars and instruments.</strong></p>

*TV – My gear is changing constantly and I have a ton of it. Tube amps, cabinets, pedals, effects… But one thing that I use constantly over the past 20 years or so is IBANEZ guitars.* 

*I own some great „Prestige“ series Japan made RG series axes, and the playability and quality of those is perfect for my. I have some 7 string instruments also but to be honest I prefer 6 string. I use 7 string for lower notes mainly.*




<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – When you listen to a new guitar player for the first time what are some of the elements that you for?</strong></p>

*TV – I think the most important thing that tunes me on is tone. And this comes from the fingers of the player, and has nothing to do with the gear that he or she is using.* 

*Not even from the guitar. Believe or not, but I can hear the players fingers. And when I like what I hear, I am IN.* 

*Next thing is the note choice, or how tasteful the player is. Then I might listen to the technical skills of the musician and how clean is the performance or is it muddy as hell.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP –  You’ve been playing and writing music for a great deal of time. Since it is a tool, how do you feel that the guitar has changed over time?</strong></p>

*TV – This is a good question. When I was a kid I listened to the bands like Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple… and the guitar was essential part of every rock even pop productions.* 

*There were great guitar heroes, Richie Blackmore, Eddie Van Halen… and guitar playing thing happened and evolved super fast, it was invented most of it, back then!*

*80,s 90,s were the golden era. When you listened back even pop hit songs of that era, the impressive and great guitar solo was always the part of the big production.* 

*It was like a cherry on the cake. Somehow winds did change late 90-s and you did not hear anymore those solos as a part of production.* 

*Even radio stations started fade out songs when the guitar solo kicks in.* 

*Fortunately today we have metal and progressive rock bands like Dream Theatre, who holds the guitar playing flag high enough.* 

*And I think there are plenty of fantastic solo guitar players out there, so lets hope for the best, for guitar!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What do you consider as the essential elements of your music?</strong></p>

*TV – The thing is melody, it has to have it. It is sometimes simple, sometimes more complex but melody is needed, even on solo sections.*

*And another thing is the inner power (or emotion, vibe), by that I mean it needs to have that amount of power to touch or shake somebody on an emotional level. Even me.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – As a solo artist does the direct attention make you feel more exposed? As opposed to being part of a joint effort in a band?</strong></p>

*TV – As a solo artist It makes you feel super responsible for the whole show. You have to hold the thing together. Everybody’s eyes are on you 100% of the time. You can’t fail!* 

*As opposed to be a part of the band, you will have your moments, but 100% attention will be always on the frontman, and he/she has the heavy load on the shoulders.*

*I learned this lesson when I started my solo artist live gigs and it is super hard at first, but it gets better with the time.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Since your writing and playing are so rich and diverse, music-wise, where is your heart?</strong></p>

*TV – Metal! and Jazz! And Classical music!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How would you comment on the experience as a solo artist vs. being a band member?</strong></p>

*TV – The experience is amazing and when you get positive feedback It makes you feel that you are doing the right thing. That someone was entertained because of you! This is wonderful feeling!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You studies clarinet as a child but were motivated as a teenager you pick up the guitar after seeing a rehearsal. Tell us about your first memory picking up the guitar? Would you choose a different path now?</strong></p>

*TV – As long as I remember it was earth shaking feeling. The first memories are that I pick up the guitar, on the local high school band casting, that I was invited by and they somehow thought that I know how to play a guitar.*

*I did not!* 

*I only knew how to play clarinet, and this was totally different animal. Ok I plugged it to an amplifier and I probably knew how to finger open Em chord.* 

*And that was it, I was in the band. And I don’t regret anything, I would not choose different path.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How often does overdubbing come to play?</strong></p>

*TV – I do a lot of overdubs at studio, specially on rhythm guitar parts and riffs, to make them fat and more powerful and stereo wise left and right panned.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – When do you feel a song is done and can be added on an album?</strong></p>

*TV – I don’t know? I just feel at some point that all the building blocks are in right places and I have to make that decision, otherwise my music will never be released, cause you always can find those little pieces that you want to fix.* 

*It is also like you have to let go of your baby, when you feel that it is the time. And the peace of mind follows.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Are you your biggest and ultimate critic?</strong></p>

*TV – Ooo yes, I am. When I record something, I constantly discover myself in a moment that I need to stop myself not to over improve stuff, that is perfectly fine already.*

*And as my good friend, great guitar guru, wise man once said, “you can’t play better than somebody, the only one that you can play better than is yourself” …I am in that trap forever.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What did you find to be the biggest challenges during the creation process?</strong></p>

*TV – Maybe the greatest challenge is to get or set yourself in the right mood, to let the creative flow happen.* 

*Sometimes it happens, sometimes not. And you have to accept that! This was not the day. Simple as that and move on.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – As an artist you are clearly not interested in writing and being associated with commercial music.</strong></p>

*TV – I have done some commercials in the past and It is a good money, when you have a right deal. I have nothing against earning some extra bucks.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Outside the music realm, what are some other activities that Toomas enjoys just as much?</strong></p>

*TV – As I live countryside, not far from the big city I have my property, and in summertime I like to build stuff.* 

*I have some good quality tools for woodworking and I name it constructing. I enjoy it really.* 

*I also have a 7,2m long motor boat and in summer the best time is on the sea just cruising or sometimes even try to catch some fish.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Time for the last questions, THE RANDOM QUESTION.* 

*Name at least 1 “fact” about Estonia that is 100% true and one that is 100% nonsense?</strong></p>

*TV – For that answer I did some googling.*

*This fact is 100% true: „The world’s most performed living composer, Arvo Pärt, is an Estonian.“*

*The fact that is completely nonsense to me is: “Estonia has the highest number of supermodels per capita”.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Toomas, thank you once again for your time and interest in speaking to us.</strong></p>

*TV – Thank you and if you have an interest to my music please have listen to it on Spotify or other digital platforms.* 

*In case you have interest to physical copies you can find me on Facebook or Instagram and order those from me directly.*

*Take care and good luck!*`,

    title: "Reactory Interview",

    text: `Berlin based high-speed thrashers [**Reactory**](https://www.facebook.com/REACTORY/) aligned their technicality, uncompromising variety and warp-like speed back in 2010.

Having already released a Demo (2011), the **“Killed by Thrash”** EP (2013), full length albums **“High on Radiation”** (2014) and **“Heavy”** (2016), [**Reactory**](https://www.facebook.com/REACTORY/) is currently working on their third full material.

The four catalysts behind [**Reactory**](https://www.facebook.com/REACTORY/) Thrash warhead are: **Hänz Hazard** (vox), **Jerry Reactor** (guitar),  **Jonny Master** (bass) and **Caue Dos Santos** (drums).

*As always, a huge **Thank You** to the band for their time, openness and availability!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Welcome Thrash masters, greetings from AAP! It’s an honour to have you with us. What is the current mood in Reactory?</strong></p>

*Hello Cristina! Thanks for the interest in Reactory.* 

*Right now, to be honest, the mood is great. I mean, we are all tired as hell from a long ride back home to Berlin but very satisfied and proud after a week recording our new album nearby Köln.* 

*It was intense and we are really looking forward to bring it out.* 

*Personally I am still so pumped about it that I need some time to calm down. Answering this interview is doing the job.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You guys are working on your 3rd full album – any spoilers?</strong></p>

*All we can say for now is that we put a lot of passion and energy into it during the whole process and some of the best songs we have written up until now are there.* 

*Of course we hope thrashers will dig it, but we follow our instinct and at the end of the day, it sounds like us.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You chose to record the new album at [Gernhart Studio](https://www.facebook.com/gernhartstudio78/), again. How are the recording sessions going?</strong></p>

*We know Martin already and felt like a natural decision to go back there. The sessions were great.* 

*From all the albums we recorded, this was the one we were the sharpest on our instruments, preparing months before to go in there and literally thrash those songs the hardest we can.* 

*It happened in a span of a week and Martin, besides knowing his shit with all the technical aspects like a boss, also possesses a great musical ear and will push you just right to the point of playing beyond the best you think you can.*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Any plans for a new video for the upcoming album?</strong></p>

*Sure thing, I’d say even more than one. Probably will follow the style from the ones before but with a crazier twist and talking about the themes present on the new album. Shout out to the [Soffocazzo Video](https://www.facebook.com/soffocazzo/) maniacs!*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Who writes the lyrics and what are some of the themes on for the new material?</strong></p>

*Hans is the mastermind behind the lyrics and can tell better about it than me. But of course we all read and get into the texts also to get a riff turning into an actual song.* 

*I see the lyrics on this new album reflecting a lot of things there are somewhat up to date with the actual state of the world and how people are reacting to that.* 

*Fucking all the natural resources and exploiting Mother Earth like we did and still do, are bringing serious consequences upon mankind and that will not get any smoother.* 

*Some other things too, such as the science applied to new warfare high tech killing methods for completely unnecessary reasons and the usual disgust towards how fucked up this all became.* 

*I could see the dude was angry when shouting his parts during the recording sessions. Not a happy album.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is the songwriting process within Reactory, how do songs come to life?</strong></p>

*Most of the times, Jerry has an idea for a riff, or even a melody and present to us in our basement, or in some cases record already the main thing at his home and send it to us.* 

*It may or may not contain an idea for a rhythm, and we start to putting the pieces together from there until we feel like it is right and add vocals to it.* 

*Sometimes after the instruments are there we may play a part longer of shorter to fit words to it. We do not really ‘jam’ a lot when talking about creating Reactory stuff but everybody in the band voices their opinions if the thing is really thrashing or just not rocking that hard.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You have had a stable line-up for a long time. What kind of a relationship is necessary between members in general and in your case?</strong></p>

*Well, we are not the youngest around anymore and I would say it is more than just being able to be stuck in a van for a month or so, of course you gotta do that too, but in our case, we still like to hang together and still have fun playing a gig, or just drinking a beer out of a band/concert situation.* 

*I try to stick to the old DBAA philosophy, don’t be an asshole, and it works most of the time. We just took a step further on our silly bromance and the four members got a band tattoo some weeks ago.* 

*Must say in all these years, I can not remember one time that shit got serious and someone got really pissed off with the other. We are just chill dudes.*

filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is a favorite piece of gear for each of you? (Beer counts as well)</strong></p>

*OK, I am gonna guess this one because I am not answering for them but as for now, I think it is:*

*Ulli is still in love with his bass amp. I think it has been a year already since he got the damn thing. But hell, we all love that mean bass sound.* 

*Jerry was trying some effect pedals but I would say he is more into his loyal axe.* 

*I am a drummer, so I really dig my new cymbals, like drummers do.* 

*Hans does not know his mic model. We all drink beer, smoke cigs and doobies if that is all into gear category as well.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What would you say your individual strength is musician?</strong></p>

*I wouldn’t say we are technical on our instruments but focus more on playing tight and hard as possible and still trying to sound musical and not only playing light-speed all times, being open for an idea or support musically what the other guys are doing.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is the history of Reactory, how did you come together?</strong></p>

*Jerry and Hans talked about the idea of playing aggressive thrash, around late 2010, the guys have known each other for ages already.* 

*Jerry asked Ulli for playing bass and Stachu played the drums on the demo and on the Killed by Thrash EP.* 

*I joined the band in the summer of 2013. Already knew Hans, at the time was living on the same floor as Jerry and got to meet Ulli in the band.* 

*We are all old punk rockers with a metal heart. Have been playing since then with this line up.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – And what was your first contact with music and your instruments? Was the idea to form a band in you from the start?</strong></p>

*I speak for myself on this one. Born and raised in Sao Paulo, I was lucky enough to be in a very musical family, with a broad musical range, from regional music to a bit a classic, and a good portion of 70s rock through old records from my father and his brother who also played instruments.* 

*I gravitated towards the whole thing very naturally. Going to concerts from the folk group that my father played at the time was cool, it just felt nice to hang with that bunch of weirdos and as a kid it all seemed very interesting.* 

*On the early teenage years I dove head first into punk and by the time I was 15 years old and had the first school concert playing snotty versions of Ratos de Porao, Ramones and Nirvana.*
 
*I never stopped since then, not even once there was a time where I was bandless after that. Maybe I should start gardening...*

filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Your name is very visual, your imagery and overall concept is pure Thrash and vivid. What is the story behind the name?</strong></p>

*I think Hans had the idea for the name and kept in his stash until it was time for it. I really like the name and think it sounds just like our music. Rough and nuclear.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is your favourite type of venue since you have an individual sound and also carry props as well?</strong></p>

*We do not carry props besides our backdrop and if we can set up our gear, we sure prefer to bring our own backline.* 

*I think it is cool if a band wants to put some effort into their live show with props and stuff besides the music, but it is just not our thing too much.* 

*My favorite type of venue are the ones were the crowd can go wild, no barricades or security guys, you can hear yourself and the other guys on stage and a fair amount of beer.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Performing live shows at home or abroad: what is better, harder or easier?</strong></p>

*There is not really better. Abroad is more exciting especially if we were not there before but is also harder since you don’t know what to expect from people, culture, down to gear and logistical shenanigans.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Speaking of which, will cover art be signed by [Doomsday Graphics](https://www.facebook.com/people/Doomsday-Graphics/100063528068682/) this time around as well? How did the collaboration start?</strong></p>

*Nesha is a good friend of us and already did and still does illustrations for many bands, festivals and venues around the globe.* 

*He captured the imagery of the band for the first moment on and he lives in the same city, which makes the whole process a lot easier when discussing ideas in person and not over the internet only. He is in charge for the next album cover.*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – The next months you will be touring quite a lot, got some shows lined up with Exumer. Any expectations?</strong></p>

*We are really looking forward to this one. Many cities and places we haven’t played before, with a new set list presenting the songs from the upcoming album also and a killer package of bands.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Some of you were involved in side projects such as [Social Chaos](https://www.facebook.com/socialchaos666/) and [Tankobot](https://www.facebook.com/tankobot/) – are either still active / are you involved in any more or less musical projects?</strong></p>

*I would not say side projects, since Reactory was not around when we were active with these bands. I know Social Chaos is still active and I think Tankobot too.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How did the collaboration with [FDA Records](https://www.facebook.com/FDAREC/) come about?</strong></p>

*Rico approached us and we knew about his work too, having a more death metal output and a good distribution. The records are sold out and it was a good partnership.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Is there anything in particular you are looking forward to achieving in the near future or are you open to any opportunity?</strong></p>

*For the near future, to make this new record come out sounding and looking as good as possible and honestly, not open to ANY opportunity.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You are turning almost 10 years now and not only you have a strong foothold but you have established an identity – how does it feel to stop and look back at all you have experienced so far?</strong></p>

*I think we still have a lot ahead of us and as long as we have fun playing these songs and being as a unit, we gonna do it. What I want to say it that we are looking more to the future than to the past 10 years, that sure, were great too, but now we all are very confident being who we are. Gee, I’m high as fuck!*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How much was instinct and how much was thinking it out when finding own sound and image?</strong></p>

*Sound it is for the most part instinct, like, if your guts and ears and energy feels thrashy enough, and makes you want to headbang to what you are playing you know it is right.* 

*Image, like i said about stage props and stuff, we just go on stage the way we were dressed before and there is not much to it. Only untold rule is no flip flops. But I just told.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is your opinion on sound change – being experimental or setting a trademark?</strong></p>

*I like both and think that is good to some bands and horrible for others. We can try some things as a band but by now, we know like a song of Reactory should sound.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – For Reactory is Thrash a statement or music / a means of expression? Or both?</strong></p>

*Both. But I am more fond of the pissed off, angry, aggressive thrash than the pizza/beer kind of thrash. Each own on its time.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Any hidden talents and hobbies?</strong></p>

*Some I guess. Not naming names though. Mixing drinks, chess brutalism, drunken astronomy and stoned stargazing, performing electric wiring at dangerous places, late hour karaoke and gardening.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Do you prefer live shows or studio time? Both instances have their charm.</strong></p>

*Studio is hard and then is fun. Shows are most fun sure, but we still have to haul our gear out.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – I remember the Reactory show in Bucharest back in 2014 like it was yesterday. What would be your best live show memory?</strong></p>

*From Bucharest specifically I remember a very energetic concert and hanging with the maniacs from Crossbones and the local thrashers afterwards. Great times. Hope we come back soon. Best memory for me are moshers going crazy during the concert. Boring answer but true shit.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Time for the last question, the RANDOM QUESTION: If you had the world’s attention for 30 seconds, what would you say?</strong></p>

*Put your phone down and stop being such a prick. 3 seconds might be enough.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Thanks again for taking the time to do this! If there is anything I may have missed and you would like to mention, please, do!</strong></p>

*Thank you for your interest in the band and throwing good questions at us. Hope to see you all in the near future and have one or two beers together. THRASH!*`,

Their most recent album, **”In Control”**, was released on August 10ᵗʰ, 2019 via [LO41 Records](https://www.lo41records.com/) and it embodies 10 distinct tracks, cradling influences from Heavy Rock, AOR, bringing to life original, mature themes, with the 70’s and 80’s earmark.

[HARDLAND](https://www.hardland.net/en/) were open for a (too!) short conversation and a transcription is available below.

As always, a huge *Thank You* to the band for their time, openness and availability!

*Things are going pretty good for us, in spite of this pandemic year. We’ve been busy writing new material and just finished recording our first ever [Christmas single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLLG4MUQKTU&ab_channel=Hardland-Topic) that’s going to rock your socks off!!

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is the story behind your band name?</strong></p>

*A: The initial story was that when we were thinking of a great band name we came up with the name HARDLAND.* 

*Since most of the bandmembers come from the Heart of the country. But Heartland sounded too countryish, and since we play Melodic Alternative Rock, we decided that HARDLAND would fit perfect in every way.* 

*We checked internationally if that name was already taken and at that moment around 2010 no one used it, so we trademarked our name, band logo etc.*

*Although we weren’t actually a band at that time. It was more of a project of a couple of like-minded friends.*

*Later on I’ve noticed that there’s a band from Greece using our trademarked name!! We have contacted them a few times about it, but they chose to ignore us.*

*So now we are thinking of taking it a step further with some legal procedures. It simply doesn’t work like that, you know?*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How did you get from Heroez to HARDLAND?</strong></p>

*A: Haha, where did you hear that name, HeroeZ? That was my first band back in the late 70’s of the last century (yep, I’m not exactly a teenager anymore! Lol).* 

*It was a Rockband with 5 young guys, ultimately creative and totally gung ho about reaching for the stars! Cool thing is… we quit somewhere around 1980/1981, had a one off sold out reunion show back in 1997 and only recently came back together and decided to finally record an album, after all these years!*

*All the recordings have been taken care of and our drummer is mixing the whole project. No clue if or when it will be released, but I can tell ya, it’s got some mean and dirty rock n roll on there!!* 

*Now HARDLAND, the graphic design for our albums was done by the lead guitarist of the HeroeZ and when we recorded our new Christmas single, the drummer of the HeroeZ helped out with some amazing backing vocals.* 

*So somehow we’re still intertwined after all these years. Lol. I think that’s really awesome to still being that great of friends after 40+ years!!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Let’s meet all the band members and could you share a trait you have in common with your instrument.</strong></p>

*A: Aeilko (lead vocals / lead guitar) I just like to be at the center of attention… perhaps that’s why I do lead vocals and let my guitars scream!!, Paul (lead vocals / rhythm guitar) Paul has that same virtue of wanting to be at the center of attention, but the other half of his personality wants to be the cement that keeps it all together, Eric (drums) Backbone of the band and in real life someone you can rely on, Marco (keyboards / vocoder / coffee) as keyboardist and vocoderer he utilizes lots of weird sounds…exactly what’s coming out of his mouth!* 

*Lol….the joker of the band, together with Eric. And Remi (bass / backing vocals) what can I say about him… he’s German! 😊*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – It all started as a project. How comfortable and stable do you feel with one another today?</strong></p>

*A: True, as a project Paul and I had all the freedom to do whatever we felt like doing musically. That’s why we wrote way over a hundred songs together.* 

*The other guys in the band were no strangers to us. In the days when I had my own Mobile Recording Studio and PA Rental company, Paul and Eric worked with me doing lots of live shows and recordings of all kinds of bands.* 

*Remi worked at the same location as Paul back in the day. And Marco and I had a mutual friend who introduced us to one another.*

*So it felt quite comfortable from day one and we only became tighter and better. Only thing that is different is that we now try to involve everyone into the writing process of new material and that takes away a lot of the speed in the process of recording.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP - The song is very important to you and also you avoid repeating yourselves.</strong></p>

A: Exactly! We are influenced by so many different styles of music and artists. We couldn’t even do what a band like AC/DC does. No offence, these guys are the best! I’ve got most all of their albums, but to our ears their music is pretty one dimensional. We prefer bands like Queen, or Whitesnake, or even King’s X. They are more versatile in their musical style. That’s what we prefer above all.

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How open are you to collaborations and what would be a genre “limit” that you would not really be influenced by?</strong></p>

*A: If we were offered a chance to collaborate, we would accept that challenge whole heartedly.* 

*I don’t think we would block out any style. As long as we would be able to give it our own personal twist and make it our own, we could do any style. As long as the outcome is 100% HARDLAND!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – And how often does overdubbing come to play?</strong></p>

*A: It totally depends on the type of track we’re recording. We had a song on our first album (‘‘Dream Into Nightmare”) that had 96 tracks if I remember correctly. Lots of vocal overdubs and doubles, triples etc.* 

*Loads of different guitar tracks, a ton of different keyboard parts as well. Recording to us means creating something that is still worthwhile listening to after you’ve heard it many times. *

*And preferably every time you listen you can hear something new due to our multi-layered way of mixing. Performing live is straight forward rock n roll!!*

filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is the writing process like?</strong></p>

*A: The writing process for our third album is built on a few pillars. First of all we check if there are any completed songs or bits and pieces from earlier recordings that are worth trying to work out or re-arrange. Same goes for any lyrics that are completely or partly done and seem worthwhile.*

*Next pillar is that we write completely new songs from scratch.*

*Third pillar is that we look if there are any covers that we have played live or that we think we can totally re-arrange into a HARDLAND version.*

*None of the before mentioned is mandatory. But are just the three sides we look at things. Up until now I was the only person to (re-)arrange our music, write lyrics, come up with vocal harmonies.*

*The plan is that Marco (our keyboardist) is going to join in writing and maybe (re-)arranging stuff. We’ll see how that works.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Is composition impulsive and intuitive?</strong></p>

*A: Writing happens impulsive and intuitive and also fully thought out. Even though I can’t read or write music notes, I sometimes have complete songs fully worked out in my head.*

*I only need to record all the separate parts into the computer and send it over to the rest of the band to see if they want to change or add parts to it.* 

*One thing that doesn’t really happen is jamming…we don’t don’t really jam and record ideas.*

*Personally, that doesn’t work for me. I want to be able to jump back and forth into the ideas and jamming often means playing a certain theme over and over…which totally bores the crap outta me! Lol.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is your present practise and rehearsal routine like?</strong></p>

*A: Since April we haven’t been able to rehearse due to pandemic lockdowns etc. Once it is safe again to go out on the road we will go and rehearse shortly but fiercely to get ready for live action mode!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How is you collaboration with MetalMessage and Markus Eck and how did it come about?</strong></p>

*A: Before working with Markus we were working with a completely untrustworthy guy from Wales, England. All he wanted was money, but refused to do anything for it. So we got a little more apprehensive than we already were.*

*Talked to some friends in the business and Markus’ name came across as being a really trustworthy and passionate guy. A really hard worker.* 

*Even though I noticed he mostly worked with Metal bands (just his name says it all: Metalmessage), so I wasn’t sure if he was even interested in working with us.* 

*Talking to him we had an immediate click…he had heard our music and got impressed by it. The rest is history as they say!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – I read about “no ego no BS” applying to HARDLAND. Is there a leader in the band?</strong></p>

*A: Exactly! The only thing that matters is to create the best possible version of a song. We only think along those lines and whoever plays what, doesn’t matter.* 

*The first two albums were basically recorded and performed by mainly two guys, Paul and myself. And as Paul and I are completely different guitar players, we used whatever style necessary.* 

*It could therefor happen that in a certain song the solo or chord schemes were played by two different people. Just to make sure that the outcome was the best!*

*We totally put aside our egos to make sure that whatever we want to record is done the very best way. But with creating a complete band album this time around, I’m sure things will go a little different.* 

*Maybe I can tell you afterwards how that worked out!! Lol!*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – I saw that responsibilities are shared within the band, from video edits and merch prints, event/sound managing. You are all, also involved in more or less musical side-projects and activities?</strong></p>

*A: True! There’s no use in having people taking care of something that they know nothing about. So we divide the tasks based on our specific qualities and capabilities.* 

*And we are very fortunate to have a friends who are extremely talented in things that bands need. Such as videoclips, artwork, graphic design, Photography, etc. There’s a whole team available for us which gives us a very comfortable feeling.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – That brings a lot of variety in your lifestyles as well as your music.</strong></p>

*A: Correct! The versatility in our music can be heard on our albums. We write and record whatever makes us feel good. We are not stuck to any style or anything.* 

*Of course we keep in mind to arrange the songs in a 80’s kinda style, melodic, alternative… but we record just as easily an alternative metal track as we recorded a waltz!! Simply because we wanted to and loved it.*

*An Australian reviewer called us musical daredevils!! I love that title!! We would get bored playing the same things over and over again. And variety in our lifestyles…most definitely. Our family lives totally differ.* 

*But we all share the same passion: Music!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Speaking of which. You have a keen eye and view your albums from a buyer’s perspective. Do you have a target audience in mind? Or commercially-wise?</strong></p>

*A: Yeah… we absolutely have a target audience in mind and also focus on our material (artwork / graphic design, but also our merch).* 

*We’ve noticed that our music connects best with people from the age of 35+. People who have fond memories of the 80’s and / or love that sound. Young kids seem to listen more to a different kinda music these days.*

*With every album we think hard on how to present it. What would we love to see / receive ourselves when buying an album from our favorite bands.*

*That’s why we came up with this very special digi-pack with an extra DVD added to the album. Simply because we would love something like that ourselves and hope that our audience feels the same way.*

*That we chose a gypsy as our mascot as our cover art, has to do with the fact that our first single was titled “Hot Gypsy” and we loved that idea to take it further and create our own mascot, as what Eddy is to Iron Maiden, is this Gypsy Girl to us!*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What do you want people to take away from your music most of all?</strong></p>

*A: We hope that our music touches or resonates with people or will simply give them a good time while listening to it! Especially in the pandemic days people are in need of good vibes. There’s enough stress and misery going on right now. It’s important to be able to take a step back, let your mind relax and wonder away while listening to some great music. Don’t you agree?*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – As fans and music consumers yourselves, do you favor the old school,  physical medium, or digitalized music?</strong></p>

*A: We love all actually. The digital world has become a lot faster consumptively. An MP3 is deleted or not being listened to a lot faster and easier than when people buy a CD or Vinyl.*

*First of all because that is more expensive of course, so people want more out of it! That’s simple. I mean, digital music is a way of throwing new material out there with a chance of trying out new styles.*

*Since an MP3 doesn’t usually last as long as a CD or vinyl it doesn’t hurt us artists less if we feel like trying something different. Music that will stand the test of time will still have to be available on CD or Vinyl. So we love every opportunity, as long as people keep listening to music!! It’s up to them to decide in what shape or format they prefer to listen to it!!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Remi is learning to play cello. Do you all have similar challenges, musical or non musical?</strong></p>

*A: No, not really… at least not at the moment. Too busy preparing for Christmas! 😊 But whenever it is needed to be able to play an instrument that neither one of us knows how to play, maybe it might trigger something.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Computer game scores VS movie soundtracks?</strong></p>

*A: We love both! Totally different approach is needed. I have already worked on a movie soundtrack, a long time ago with one of my former bands. It was quite a challenge to write music based on a scene time schedule etc.* 

*We learned a lot from doing that. Game scores… would love to. Anywhere people would like to use our music, games, movies, commercials… let’s talk! 😉*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You also have in sight a band documentary? Any updates or progress?</strong></p>

*A: Yeah..lol, we started that based on filming the making of our first album and first video clip. But then we talked to professionals and they basically talked us out of it.* 

*Too much talking heads and somehow we couldn’t get the story out the way we had hoped. It didn’t work out the way we had hoped. But no biggy. You always learn stuff from things like this. We don’t consider it a failure, just a learning process. After all, we’re musicians, not movie directors! Lol.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is the most difficult song on “In Control” for each of you (and why)?</strong></p>

*A: Two songs actually, The Powers Within, due to the complex rhythm patterns in combination with singing at the same time. And the other one is Love, love, love, due to the harmonies in there that are pretty cool, but also hard to do while playing an instrument at the same time.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – As fans and musicians, what does it take for a (nowadays) band to impress you?</strong></p>

*A: Not much, really…it could be a great chorus, or guitar solo, or fantastic drum rhythm…just anything that regular listeners enjoy about a certain song. I can really appreciate the craftmanship of other musicians or vocalists!*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How do you define success?</strong></p>

*A: That’s a hard one. Success means something different to each and every one of us. How do you measure it, what’s important to you. Just the simple fact that people listen to our music and appreciate it by buying it, or streaming it, or buying merch is a proof of success.*

*Of course, you can measure it by numbers… some think you can only call yourself successful once you’ve sold a million copies of your album or so.* 

*But to me it’s not a matter of quantity as it is a matter of positive response to what we do. That’s the greatest gift of all. And of course, the more people that love what we do, the cooler it is. 😊*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is a compromises that you’re unwilling to make?</strong></p>

*A: We already passed that one… we could have signed with bigger labels but they wanted to have a say in on how we would present our music etc. We really wanted to be judged by our own qualities and flukes and if that means we miss out on a bigger market, so be it.*

*Numbers are great but only when you are appreciated for what you have created. Not by what the label pumped into the project on marketing budget or stuff like that.* 

*I see commercials for certain albums, big bucks have been put into that… and really… it sounds like the so ‘hundredth’ copy of some other artist!! Because all labels want you to work with the same people.* 

*That’s why diversity has become a lot less these past years. I prefer the indie kinda approach.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Time for the last question, the Random Question. What’s invisible but you wish people could see?</strong></p>

*A: We are a pretty transparent band, we may not always tell everything there is to tell, but that doesn’t mean we want to hide it. We mainly focus on our music and creativity.* 

*And if people like to know something, they can ask us anything and we will always answer their questions.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – In case there is anything that you would like to share and I may have missed, please do so. Thank you once again and hoping to see you live in 2021.</strong></p>

*A: We just released our first ever Christmas track: **"Merry X-mas Everybody"**. Yep a cover of the famous track by British Rockers **Slade**.* 

*It’s always tricky to cover a track that famous and that much loved. But we felt it was the only Christmas song that we cared about covering, as long as we were able to make it our own and come up with an arrangement that would totally fit the typical HARDLAND sound.*

*And biased as I may be, I think we really succeeded in that. We got kind permission of *EMI Publishing* and the guys from **Slade** to release it and we are very happy with the result.*

*Mixed by ourselves together with a good friend and mastered, as always, at **Abbey Road London** it came out really cool! Especially the Beatle-esque middle section with all the vocals was really fun to record.*

*A good friend of mine, the drummer from my very first band, **John Forsting** of **The HeroeZ**, came and contributed some great vocal parts as well.* 

*I knew he had a great voice and is as creative as we are with vocal harmonies, so it was actually a no brainer to ask him to join in.* 

*People that would like to hear or read more of **HARDLAND** can go to these links and click on every social media, website, or streaming link that shows up. We look forward to hearing the response from your readers / followers.*

    title: "Christian Fischer – Infected Chaos",

    text: `The austrian-german metalband [INFECTED CHAOS](https://www.facebook.com/InfectedChaos/) rose from the ashes of former band [Chaosreign](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Chaosreign/3540308719) in 2013 and directly started to write their own songs.
  
  After intense road-tests – among others supporting the legendary **Possessed** – the band entered the renowned [Iguana Studio](https://www.facebook.com/iguanastudios/?ref=page_internal) and could release its debut **“The Wake of Ares”** in 2015.

Only two years later the successor **“Killing Creator”** was unleashed and led the band through the half of Europe. 

Well known festivals such as [MetalDays](https://www.metaldays.net/),[Winterdays of Metal](https://www.instagram.com/winterdaysofmetal/) and [Aaargh!-Festival](https://www.aaarghfestival.de/) were *haunted*.

In 2021 **“Dead Aesthetics”** was finally recorded and released by [INFECTED CHAOS](https://www.facebook.com/InfectedChaos/).

At the moment the band is housing their own studio to create their next release.


As always, a huge **Thank You** to the band for their time, openness and availability!

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>All Access Pass – Greetings and thank you for taking the time to talk to All Access Pass. It is a pleasure to be able to run this interview! 

How are things going for [INFECTED CHAOS](https://www.facebook.com/InfectedChaos/)?</strong></p>

*Christian Fischer – Greetings All Access Pass! Thanks for doing this interview with us. We’re finally getting back in track now. 

We spend a lot of time in our rehearsal room working on the successor for Dead Aesthetics“.*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Any updates regarding the new material that you are working on?</strong></p>

*CF – What I can say by now is that it’s gonna be an EP before we will be focusing on the next full-length release. 

We probably will the first time going into a studio to take some pressure off our guitarist Matt who produced all our material so far. 

The lyrics will continue where „Dead Aesthetics“ ended and will also reveal something about the upcoming album, so, stay tuned!*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You once said that with each album, you try to do something different from the last one, while also maintaining a similarity. What should we expect from the new material?</strong></p>

*CF – That it’s definitely gonna be Infected Chaos, carrying on the typical melodies and riffing but once again be adding some other influences as we all develop as musicians.*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Can voice be seen as an instrument?</strong></p>

*CF – Absolutely. I try to develop and vary my vocals as much as possible. I think it is very important for the atmosphere of the song how the vocals sound like and are arranged. 

I really like spoken words and whispered stuff which can create something very epic within a certain song. But sometimes it just has to be brutal!*

filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Would you say that the musical direction in INFECTED CHAOS is a result of your combined tastes or was it agreed on?</strong></p>

*CF – It definitely is a result of everybody’s preferences. We got no real masterplan when it comes to creating the sound or writing songs. Everybody adds his influences and the result is Infected Chaos.*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is your writing process? Is composition impulsive and intuitive?</strong></p>

*CF – For myself it’s very impulsive. Then comes the time where it must rest and breathe and finally an intuitive phase starts where I start analyzing the song more and more, add some little details and twists in the arrangement until I’m content with the song.*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>APP – Do you imagine how these songs would play out in a live situation?</strong></p>

*CF – First of all we create songs that please ourselves. Everything that comes after this is a bonus. But of course we think about how this riff or that chorus will work live on stage. Will it be kicking? Is it even playable?*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – You once said that ‘as a singer and lyricist you do justice to yourself first’. 

Do you handle the lyrics alone? What is your favourite topic? What gets harder to pen out the melody or the lyrics?</strong></p>

*CF – I write my lyrics alone but it’s very important to me that the other members can also identify with them. 

I dig my inspiration form everyday life, you just have to watch the news to find something that pisses you off. Then I wrap my thoughts in nice little disgusting words and that’s it. 

Basically it’s nevertheless way more difficult for me to write the lyrics than finding melody or rhythm.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Is it more comfortable and expressive to write lyrics in English?</strong></p>

*CF – I think the english words fit the sound best. But I always respect bands vocalising in their mother’s tongue. Like Dordeduh or Solstafir for example. Maybe we’ll try something like that one time, too. Maybe even using our local dialect. Who knows?*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How are responsibilities shared? Is there a leader in the band?</strong></p>

*CF – Not really. We’re trying to split up the necessary activities. So one is doing more business, another more the awful social media stuff and so on. We’re a democratic band. 

Sometimes it would be easier to have a leader though. If you know what I mean 😉*

filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – When writing songs do you tend to not listen to anything or on the contrary expose yourself to any bands and styles?</strong></p>

*CF – I’m listening to different kinds of music all the time. It keeps me going onward, so I don’t isolate myself from it when I’m entering the creative mode. I don’t know how the other guys do, considering this*


<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Are you still involved in any side projects? Any non musical hobbies?</strong></p>

*CF – Our guitarists are playing in some grindcore fun projects and our bassist is doing all kind of music that has guitars in it. 

The rest of us is only in Infected Chaos. 

What I really like doing is hiking. It’s great for mental health.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Live scene is slowly getting back to life after this long hiatus. How was getting back on stage?</strong></p>

*CF – It was just absolutely awesome to finally be back on stage. We really missed playing live, feeling the energy of the crowd, talking and drinking with the fans and other musicians. 

Hopefully we can do a lot of live shows in the near future. Let’s see what happens after the summer…*

<hr style="background-color: #dfdfdf; height: 2px;box-shadow: 0px -5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); width: 100px;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25));"/>

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Are there particular songs you like to play live more than others?</strong></p>

*CF – Everybody in the band has its own favorites to play. We decide together which songs will be played at the next show. And of course you have some tunes you just HAVE to play. Imagine Iron Maiden not playing The Trooper. Impossible!*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What have been your greatest challenges to date, and your favorite moments?</strong></p>

*CF – The greatest challenges must have been finding suitable replacements for drums and bass. That was a really hard time where we almost quit. 

One of my personal favorite moments was opening for the almighty Possessed at our second show ever! But in general I enjoy every moment with this band. It doesn’t matter if we’re heading for the next gig, destroy a stage or are just goofing around. 

The band’s climate is excellent and that makes it easy to have fun.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Are you ever nervous before a show?</strong></p>

*CF – Not really. Just very focused on the gig. I always try to deliver the maximum and even a little bit more. Practicing is very important for this. If I’m feeling safe in what I’m doing I can totally sink into the music and the mood.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What still keeps you going? How do you get motivated?</strong></p>

*CF – Being able to create my vision of brutal music with these insane guys is motivation enough for me. I don’t care about money or stuff like that.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How do you define success?</strong></p>

*CF – Success for me is working with my friends in this band. Having a great time together and creating our own vision of extreme metal. Writing good songs is all it’s about. As mentioned before: the rest is bonus.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What is a compromises that INFECTED CHAOS is unwilling to make?</strong></p>

*CF – Sharing the stage with Nazis! FUCK OFF!!!*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – What do you want people to take away from your music most of all?</strong></p>

*CF – Strength!*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – As artists and fans, what does it take for a band or musician to impress you?</strong></p>

*CF – You must be able to hear that a musician definitely feels and stands for what he/she is doing. Integrity and devotion are most important.*

<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Personally I don’t believe in pigeonholing a band. 

I think that genre tags are somewhat helpful only to give an idea of the general approach of a band. What is your take on this?</strong></p>

*CF – Just the same here. We labeled ourselves Death Metal in the beginning so people have a clue what it’s roughly about, where we come from and so on. 

But all in all I don’t think this is perfectly fitting for what we#re doing. It’s metal with brutal vocals.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – How would you describe yourselves on stage and off stage?</strong></p>

*CF – We#re hard working guys when it comes to creating and performing music. Off stage we sometimes tend to be a little goofy and chaotic. We’re just trying to have a good time.*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Time for the last question, the RANDOM question: What is invisible, but you wish people could see?</strong></p>

*CF – The energy being pushed back and forth between band and fans during a metal show!*



<p style="background-color: #dfdfdf;"><strong>AAP – Thank you once again for taking the time to do this! Feel free to add something for your fans and readers or anything I may have missed.</strong></p>

CF – Thanks for this huge interview! Stay metal and support the underground!
