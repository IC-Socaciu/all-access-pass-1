**AAP –  Thank you for your time. What is Undertaker doing now?**

*Hello, we’re currently doing a lot of live shows in Tokyo, the center of Japan. And now I’m writing a lot of songs. I’m writing it for the new album.*



**AAP –  Let’s meet the band. Can you tell us a little bit about each member of the band and their role within the group?**

*First of all, I’m NEMO, guitar vocalist. Mainly writing new riffs and writing lyrics. And at the live, this is the man who is venting his anger at the center. The guitarist is 4410. He is originally from classical music. He does the booking and arrangement publicity for the band. And the drummer is Hong. He is a very studious drummer who is studying a lot of music now. The bassist is a session bassist, but he’s a genius. He can listen to the performance with peace of mind.*



**AAP –  Is the current line-up stable or are there different musicians joining the live show?**

*The bassist is a session member. The rest of the line-up is stable. Because we used to be friends. We often drink and play together.*



**AAP –  For international readers unfamiliar with The Undertaker, can you tell us how it started?**

*This band just let out what’s inside everyone in the midst of this damned pandemic. I started out playing. However, I made a lot of good songs, so I started showing them in front of everyone. I started playing like a party, but now I’m serious about it.*



**AAP –  How would you describe your music to someone who has never heard it?**

*Our music is a mixture of 90’s alternative, hard rock, hardcore and rock. Of course, it also smells like good old rock. Think of it as a new sound playing with modern sounds.*



**AAP –  Tell us more about your current EP.**

*The current EP was originally a demo, but all 4 songs were great songs, so I dropped them into the world. The reaction was good. It was ranked #16 on iTunes. It’s sprinkled with psychedelic vibes, hardcore and rock sounds.*



**AAP –  How are the songs written, are they collaborative or are they usually led by one of her members?**

*Where NEMO usually writes riffs and melodies, we jam always. I don’t compromise, but I enjoy it.*



**AAP –  Where do you get your musical inspiration from?**

*We find new inspiration in everything we’ve heard, amazing scenery and good times. I like exciting things.*



**AAP –  What do you like most and dislike about being a musician?**

*What you like is to be able to live by doing what you like. Even if we are caught in something, it will break that frame. That’s why musicians can’t quit their jobs. What I don’t like is that the world is getting louder and louder. Maybe it’s mostly because of social net media.*



**AAP –  You just signed a new partnership with Split Screen Management. How did the collaboration come about?**

*They have been able to maintain a good partnership continuing from my previous band. They work hard for the band. That’s why I love it. Great management company.*



**AAP –  What’s next for The Undertaker?**

*I want to make an album. And I want to tour a lot and make new trips!*



**AAP –  How did you get into music? Was it always part of your life or did you focus on it later on?**

*I love guitar and it’s been my life since the beginning.*



**AAP –  Are either of you involved in musical or non-musical side projects?**

*Right now I’m just concentrating on this band.*



**AAP –  The year started with quite a few live shows. How has the reaction been so far?**

*The reaction is good. People are very interested. However, it’s hard to categorize it because it’s a sound I had never heard before.*



**AAP –  Do you have any upcoming shows?**

*There are a lot of shows booked, mainly in Tokyo, until the fall. Of course I want to tour Europe if I have the chance.*



**AAP –  You are a very visual band when playing live. What should fans expect from your show?**

*We double as a show-up to Rock’s bluntness. That’s why I’m progressing through stages that I can’t read every time. Is that more thrilling?*



**AAP –  Do you get nervous before the show?**

*I’m having fun these days, so I’m not nervous. My previous band was always nervous and crazy enough to want to hurt someone. I’m quietly concentrating. I train the image of the stage all the time.*



**AAP –  Do you have any funny or interesting stories from the show so far that you could share with us?**

*The support guitarist who was in the front drinks a lot. I drink all the time after loading in. And before the stage, after he checked his guitar, he disappeared. it was the best and the worst story so far.*



**AAP –  Last Question Time – Random Questions. Name at least one thing about Japan that is 100% true and 100% nonsense.**

*Japan is a very strange country and rock has yet to become a culture. All pop music and idols make me nauseous. This is serious. Japan has a lot of weird rules. After that, we will act as a group. The audience gets excited, and if one person gets excited, everyone gets excited.*



**AAP –  If there is anything you would like to share and I may have missed, please do so. We look forward to seeing you in Europe.**


*See you in Europe! And thank you for your support!*`,

    title: "Godmorgon Interview",

    text: `Founded in 2019, **GODMORGON**, is a Punk-infused Death Metal/Sludge band from Dortmund (Germany) that has developed into a death/sludge metal band combining harsh vocals, groovy riffs and raw, straightforward energy.

The band's sound has been shaped by the many different musical influences of the band's members: hardcore, punk, doom, extreme metal, grindcore and even black metal. Lyrical themes include feminism, anti-capitalism and warnings of an apocalyptic future if humanity continues to let this world go to shit.

Current **GODMORGON** lineup: 

**Itza** (Vocals)

**Marvin** (Gitarre)

**Jan** (Bass/Vocals)

**Simon*+ (Drums)

As always, a huge *Thank You* to the band for their time, openness and availability!


**All Access Pass – Hello, GODMORGON and thank you for taking the time to talk to All Access Pass. It’s a pleasure to have you here!**

*Itza: Thank you for having us!*


**AAP – For newer fans, let’s meet everyone in GODMORGON!**

*I: The band consists of four people: Marvin on guitar, Jan on bass and backing vocals, Simon on the drums and me, Itza, as the lead vocalist.*



**AAP – Your latest material, the “Backlash” EP has been released at the beginning of 2022. A new single and video for the song “Cataclysm” has just been released in May. How does it feel to finally have your self-titled debut EP out, in the world?**

*I: It was actually quite spontaneous. Our original plan was to record our first album sometime in 2022. But last winter we had an online gig where we had to submit 1-2 pre-recorded songs for a livestream, preferably with live shot videos. We didn’t have that until then and did the songs in one go. We were very happy with how the audio turned out and decided to put it up on Spotify and other streaming services together with our first recorded song from May 2021: “Backlash”. The videos are also on our GODMORGON YouTube channel.*



**AAP – You are already back in the saddle working on your first full album. How are things progressing?**

*I: At the moment not as well as we’d like. We are currently quite busy with personal stuff and also preparing and looking forward to our next live show in August. It’s going to be at AZ Mülheim on 13th August! I’m actually organising the event.*



**AAP – What are some technical details regarding the album?**

*I: As before we are recording and mixing everything ourselves again. Simon has become our “sound guy” and coordinates the recording and does the mixing, of course with feedback from the rest of the band. I think you can really hear the progress in terms of quality of the recordings if you compare e.g. “Backlash” and “Cataclysm”. There's a lot to learn when it comes to audio engineering. For the cover art we don't have a specific vision yet, but it is probably going to be in the style of the previous covers, so rather a photo than a drawing.*



**AAP – Your previous musical offerings were 100% DIY. There is a lot of work and effort but I can imagine rewarding as well. How are responsibilities shared within GODMORGON?**

*I: As I just mentioned Simon takes care of the recordings. Jan did the Backlash video, in the future it would be cool to make a video together, featuring all band members. The guitar and bass parts of the songs are usually documented in GuitarPro which is done by Marvin. I take care of the management and communication side of things, including social media and write almost all of the lyrics. However, the lyrics for half of our pusblished songs, “Ritual Suicide” and “Backlash”, were written by Jan. So compared to other bands we really try to share the tasks and everyone has a special niche.*

![Godmorgon](https://all-access-pass.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_5371_-684x456.jpg)

**AAP – What do you find challenging in being an artist, both on a positive spin and a negative one?**

*I: It takes time and time is what most of us are lacking. For the management and social media tasks I can always find time to squeeze it in between. But when you want to focus and be creative you usually need a bit more time and you cannot force it. This can be challenging. On the positive side it’s really cool to get feedback from people who listen to your music and be able to share that joy with others.*



**AAP – Do you consider your voice as an instrument – tool?**

*I: Definitely! Besides being able to express myself with my lyrics I think, especially with “extreme” vocals you can definitely create a certain atmosphere and get feelings across quite well.*



**AAP – How much of your success do you think is achieved through social media?**

*I: Unfortunately, I think it plays a big role unless you just happen to know lots of people in your local scene. When looking for bands for gigs people also look at your follower count to determine whether people would be interested in seeing your show. But first and foremost, we care about music and not generating content all the time. If there’s something worth sharing, we’ll share it though!*



**AAP – Time for the last question, The Random Question: What is invisible but you wish people would see?**

*I: How much of a positive impact just being friendly can have. It doesn’t cost a thing and we should all try to empower each other instead of trying to outdo one another.*



**AAP – Thank you for taking the time to do this, it was really nice meeting you. In case there is anything else you would like to mention and send a message for your fans, please do so!**

*I: Thank you so much for the interview, it was really fun! I just want to repeat that our next gig is on 13th August at AZ Mülheim. Also check out the other bands in the UNTIER Collective. And I want to encourage everyone who’s interested in making music to try it out!*

    title: "Toomas Vanem Interview",

    text: `Estonian studio and session guitar virtuoso and composer **TOOMAS VANEM**, started his music career in the 1980s.

Over the years Toomas has played in multiple rock bands and projects and has remarkable career also as session musician.

In 2014 Toomas Vanem wrote, recorded and produced his first solo instrumental progressive rock music album **“Toomas Vanem I”**, which features American bass legend *Stu Hamm*. The compositions on the album are harsh, but also varied and colorful. A collage of different stories / stories about the world and life written in the language of music.

**“Toomas Vanem II”**, was released at the beginning of 2022 and it is self described as *“unique blend of styles from jazz to metal fusion music that is far beyond the limits of your imagination”*. 
**“Toomas Vanem II”** was mixed and produced by **Toomas Vanem** and mastered by **Keijo Koppel** at **RoundSound Studios**. 
The cover art is signed by **Merliis Järve** and the album design was realized by **Maris Savik**.

In recent news, **TOOMAS VANEM** has been invited to play on festival **SÕRU JAZZ FESTIVAL**, which will be held on 18.06.2022 on the Estonian island of Hiiumaa.

  

*As always, a huge **Thank You** for your time, openness and availability!*

  

**AAP – Hello, Toomas! Welcome on our virtual pages and thank you for taking the time to do this interview with All-Access-Pass!**

*Toomas Vanem: Hi, thank you for the opportunity to talk to you! The pleasure is all mine!*


**AAP – The year 2022 kicked off with the release of your newest instrumental album, “Toomas Vanem II”.**

*TV – Yes, that’s true. This is my second solo album and to be honest it took me a little too long to finish it. My first one was released 2014 so it is 8 years. Hope to rise a tempo little bit with the third one, which is in my mind and few things are also on my hard disks already. I am very grateful to all the fabulous people that helped and supported me to finish “Toomas Vanem II” and pushed me towards the release. Thank you so much!*


**AAP – The tracks on the “Toomas Vanem II” album are just as assorted style-wise but the sound and approach are slightly darker and heavier. The influences appear to be infiltrated even more subtly in each song. Looking back to your previous solo material “Toomas Vanem I” do the new ideas start spontaneous or you start with a vision of what you want the album to sound like?**

*TV – Well there is both! I write music quite spontaneously, whatever comes to my mind and whatever mood I am in, and so on. I usually come up with composing about 12-15 songs for album. At some point I stop and start looking back what I have written, and choose tracks that will end up on the album, and finish them. I might change also the arrangements to fit the overall mood a bit for album.

In general I want my album to sound happy and make people feeling good while listening to it. On my first solo album I was experimenting with different styles. On new album the experimenting continues and to be honest my vision or goal for the great instrumental guitar album is kind of old school maybe, but I like Jeff Beck records for instance, where tracks wary little bit genre or style-wise, but there is still Jeff’s guitar playing on top all of them. And you don’t get bored listening. Those are different stories that guitar player is telling you through his music on the album. I have listened to some so called conceptual albums, where for me, there is really only one song happening on the album, all the other tracks are kind of versions of that same song. I try to avoid that with my albums. I like stories! It keeps things fresh for me! With that in mind, my albums are conceptual, just I have a different concept!*


**AAP – How did the collaboration with Andrus Lillepea, Kyle Hughes, Henno Kelp, Runno Tamra come about?**

* TV – Andrus and Henno are good buddies of mine and hell of a great professional musicians. They are my partners to do also live shows with when we have a chance to play my music. Kyle Hughes appears on the album as quest star. He somehow heard my first album and liked it so much that contacted me and offered to play tracks to my new album. I said why not, lets do it, and Kyle did his brilliant drumming at UK and send files to me over the internet.*


**AAP – Do you have a personal favorite track off the “Toomas Vanem II” album? And why?**

*TV – Well, not really. I dig them all.*


**AAP – As an artist that masters both, would you tip the scales in favour of melody or virtuosity? Which one is more important or if this is the same case for you?**

*TV – For me, music is melody! The melody could be simple and It could be super complex, but it has to touch your ears as a listener on emotional basis. Music without melody is not music at all for me. There exists music without a melody but I am not super excited about that. I think some sort of virtuosity is also needed to impress listeners and entertain your audience or public. But it does not mean that you must or have play fast. Virtuosity is much more than just random fast shred on the neck of the guitar.*

**AAP – What is you composing approach, you seem to use lot of scales and unusual chords and harmonies. Tell us more about how you write your music?**

*TV – The chords and scales are the same thing really. For my compositional concept chords and harmonies comes from scales. On both my albums I have used plenty of unusual exotic scales. By that I mean I try to look away, to the different direction from major/minor or blues scale. Which are also fine. I have used Indian scales (Pantuvarali) and Modes of melodic minor and other stuff. Thing is, I take a scale and write it down on the paper, all the different chords that are possible to construct from that scale notes. Then I start experimenting and playing around with those chords, and compose melodies or riffs out of that scale, and modulate and do other crazy stuff. This is nothing new to jazz musicians or players. But in rock music this is not so common.*


**AAP – When writing new music do you seclude yourself from any influences or, on the contrary, listen to more music and expose yourself to more styles and new artists?**

*TV – I think that I can not seclude myself from the influences that I have, cause they are deep inside of me anyway. But what I do when I am writing, I try to let go of everything that I have heard and let my imagination fly free. And move fast to the directions that my creative mind wants to go. I don’t want to finish the details as I write, cause this would put breaks and stop the creative juice flowing. I can always come back later, next day and re-polish things when I am arranging/producing the song.

And another thing is that I am constantly trying to grow to not sound as other artists and would like to have my own style. But of course everything that is around influences you, by that I mean everything, not just music.*


**AAP – What is your guitar practice routine?**

*TV – When I was younger then I think I had some practice routine, But now I just practice when it is needed. And It always happens to be in the last minute…hahaha… Like before new gig with my music from my albums. Try to figure out, how the hell I am gonna play this stuff. But seriously just to get my fingers moving I do from time to time some exercising. It could be Frank Gambali’s „Chop Builder“ video that will get me in shape pretty quickly or some other stuff.*


**AAP – Do you have any favourite gear piece / setup? You also seem to be quite open to 6+ stringed guitars and instruments.**

*TV – My gear is changing constantly and I have a ton of it. Tube amps, cabinets, pedals, effects… But one thing that I use constantly over the past 20 years or so is IBANEZ guitars. I own some great „Prestige“ series Japan made RG series axes, and the playability and quality of those is perfect for my. I have some 7 string instruments also but to be honest I prefer 6 string. I use 7 string for lower notes mainly.*


![Toomas Vanem](https://all-access-pass.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MG_8603-1-683x1024.jpg)


**AAP – When you listen to a new guitar player for the first time what are some of the elements that you for?**

*TV – I think the most important thing that tunes me on is tone. And this comes from the fingers of the player, and has nothing to do with the gear that he or she is using. Not even from the guitar. Believe or not, but I can hear the players fingers. And when I like what I hear, I am IN. Next thing is the note choice, or how tasteful the player is. Then I might listen to the technical skills of the musician and how clean is the performance or is it muddy as hell.*

**AAP –  You’ve been playing and writing music for a great deal of time. Since it is a tool, how do you feel that the guitar has changed over time?**

*TV – This is a good question. When I was a kid I listened to the bands like Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple…and the guitar was essential part of every rock even pop productions. There were great guitar heroes, Richie Blackmore, Eddie Van Halen…

and guitar playing thing happened and evolved super fast, it was invented most of it, back then! 80,s 90,s were the golden area. When you listened back even pop hit songs of that era, the impressive and great guitar solo was always the part of the big production. It was like a cherry on the cake. Somehow winds did change late 90-s and you did not hear anymore those solos as a part of production. Even radio stations started fade out songs when the guitar solo kicks in. Fortunately today we have metal and progressive rock bands like Dream Theatre, who holds the guitar playing flag high enough. And I think there are plenty of fantastic solo guitar players out there, so lets hope for the best, for guitar!*

**AAP – What do you consider as the essential elements of your music?**

*TV – The thing is melody, it has to have it. It is sometimes simple, sometimes more complex but melody is needed, even on solo sections.

And another thing is the inner power (or emotion, vibe), by that I mean it needs to have that amount of power to touch or shake somebody on an emotional level. Even me.*

**AAP – As a solo artist does the direct attention make you feel more exposed? As opposed to being part of a joint effort in a band?**

*TV – As a solo artist It makes you feel super responsible for the whole show. You have to hold the thing together. Everybody’s eyes are on you 100% of the time. You can’t fail! As opposed to be a part of the band, you will have your moments, but 100% attention will be always on the frontman, and he/she has the heavy load on the shoulders.

I learned this lesson when I started my solo artist live gigs and it is super hard at first, but it gets better with the time.*

![Toomas Live](https://all-access-pass.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Philly-1-684x629.png)


**AAP – Since your writing and playing are so rich and diverse, music-wise, where is your heart?**

*TV – Metal! and Jazz! And Classical music!* 

**AAP – How would you comment on the experience as a solo artist vs. being a band member?**

*TV – The experience is amazing and when you get positive feedback It makes you feel that you are doing the right thing. That someone was entertained because of you! This is wonderful feeling!*

**AAP – You studies clarinet as a child but were motivated as a teenager you pick up the guitar after seeing a rehearsal. Tell us about your first memory picking up the guitar? Would you choose a different path now?**

*TV – As long as I remember it was earth shaking feeling. The first memories are that I pick up the guitar, on the local high school band casting, that I was invited buy and they somehow thought that I know how to play a guitar. I did not! I only knew how to play clarinet, and this was totally different animal. Ok I plugged it to an amplifier and I probably knew how to finger open Em chord. And that was it, I was in the band. And I don’t regret anything, I would not choose different path.*

**AAP – How often does overdubbing come to play?**

*TV – I do a lot of overdubs at studio, specially on rhythm guitar parts and riffs, to make them fat and more powerful and stereo wise left and right panned.*

**AAP – When do you feel a song is done and can be added on an album?**

*TV – I don’t know? I just feel at some point that all the building blocks are in right places and I have to make that decision, otherwise my music will never be released, cause you always can find those little pieces that you want to fix. It is also like you have to let go of your baby, when you feel that it is the time. And the peace of mind follows.*

**AAP – Are you your biggest and ultimate critic?**

*TV – Ooo yes, I am. When I record something, I constantly discover myself in a moment that I need to stop myself not to over improve stuff, that is perfectly fine already.

And as my good friend, great guitar guru, wise man once said, “you can’t play better than somebody, the only one that you can play better than is yourself” …I am in that trap forever.*

**AAP – What did you find to be the biggest challenges during the creation process?**

*TV – Maybe the greatest challenge is to get or set yourself in the right mood, to let the creative flow happen. Sometimes it happens, sometimes not. And you have to accept that! This was not the day. Simple as that and move on.*



**AAP – As an artist you are clearly not interested in writing and being associated with commercial music.**

*TV – I have done some commercials in the past and It is a good money, when you have a right deal. I have nothing against earning some extra bucks.*

**AAP – Outside the music realm, what are some other activities that Toomas enjoys just as much?**

*TV – As I live countryside, not far from the big city I have my property, and in summertime I like to build stuff. I have some good quality tools for woodworking and I name it constructing. I enjoy it really. I also have a 7,2m long motor boat and in summer the best time is on the sea just cruising or sometimes even try to catch some fish.*

**AAP – Time for the last questions, THE RANDOM QUESTION. Name at least 1 “fact” about Estonia that is 100% true and one that is 100% nonsense?**

*TV – For that answer I did some googling.

This fact is 100% true: „The world’s most performed living composer, Arvo Pärt, is an Estonian.“

The fact that is completely nonsense to me is: “Estonia has the highest number of supermodels per capita”.*

**AAP – Toomas, thank you once again for your time and interest in speaking to us.**

*TV – Thank you and If you have an interest to my music please have listen to it on Spotify or other digital platforms. In case you have interest to physical copies you can find me on Facebook or Instagram and order those from me directly.

Take care and good luck!*

It’s an honour to have you with us. What is the current mood in Reactory?Hello Cristina! Thanks for the interest in Reactory. Right now, to be honest, the mood is great. 

I mean, we are all tired as hell from a long ride back home to Berlin but very satisfied and proud after a week recording our new album nearby Köln. It was intense and we are really looking forward to bring it out.


Personally I am still so pumped about it that I need some time to calm down. Answering this interview is doing the job. MAtW – You guys are working on your 3rd full album – any spoilers?All we can say for now is that we put a lot of passion and energy into it during the whole process and some of the best songs we have written up until now are there. Of course we hope thrashers will dig it, but we follow our instinct and at the end of the day, it sounds like us.`,

    text: `The austrian-german metalband INFECTED CHAOS rose from the ashes of former band Chaosreign in 2013 and directly started to write their own songs. 

After intense road-tests – among others supporting the legendary Possessed – the band entered the renowned Iguana Studio and could release its debut “The Wake of Ares” in 2015. Only two years later the successor “Killing Creator” was unleashed and led the band through the half of Europe. 

Well known festivals such as MetalDays, Winterdays of Metal and Aaargh!-Festival were haunted. In 2021 “Dead Aesthetics” was finally recorded and released by INFECTED CHAOS. At the moment the band is housing their own studio to create their next release.`,
